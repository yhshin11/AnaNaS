To retreive the code from CVS
=============================

Check your CVSROOT variable.

Note: if your CMS CVSROOT is not already setup, 

 export CVSROOT=":ext:<user>@cmscvs.cern.ch:/cvs_server/repositories/CMSSW"
 export CVS_RSH="ssh"

where <user> is your user id at cern. This can go in your .bashrc file.
You'll have to enter your password at each cvs operation.

From the location where you want to install the code

> cvs co -d AnaNaS UserCode/GautierHdeM/AnaNaS

To build the applications
=========================

- > cd AnaNaS
- AnaNaS> source setup
        (switch to bash shell if needed))

Note: you'll get a warning message if the workdir/data link is not set up.
This is the link to the location of data files on your system.
- AnaNaS> cd workdir
- AnaNaS/workdir> ln -sf <someBigDisk>/<theDataTopDirectory> data

For instance (as of sept 09) to access version v02 of ntuples on dapint:

- AnaNaS/workdir> ln -sf /home/gpfs/manip/mnt/cms/mmarionn/data/v02 data

To build the applications

- AnaNaS/workdir> build
(this command can be issued from anywhere)

To run the Analysis
===================

- AnaNaS/workdir> analysis -a <analysis> -s <sample> -n <nevent>
(this command can be issued from anywhere)

To run the Display
==================

- AnaNaS/workdir> display -f <file.root>
(this command can be issued from anywhere)
